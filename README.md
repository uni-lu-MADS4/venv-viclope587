# Homework Instructions  

### Overview  
In this practical assignment, you've been assigned a random code file (e.g., `Q<number>.py`). Your task is to set it up, share it with your teammate, and ensure everything works smoothly. Follow these steps carefully to complete the assignment.

> Note: If you see the `Questions` folder and don't find your assigned question there, don't panic! Wait for a moment for the fortune wheel to turn, then reload the page. Your question will appear soon.

### Step 1: Set It Up  

1. Install the required packages, but donâ€™t just install them directly in the terminal. Instead:  
   - Create a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yaml` file for package management.  
   - Add a `how_to_run.md` file to explain how to install the packages and run your code.  

> Tip: Keep your instructions clear and precise. Assume someone unfamiliar with your setup will follow them.

### Step 2: Share and Test  

Now it's time to test your work with your teammate:  
1. Share your repo with them.  
2. Your teammate should:  
   - Clone your repo.  
   - Create a virtual environment (using either **pip** or **conda**, based on your instructions).  
   - Install the packages specified in your `how_to_run.md` file.  

> Important: Your instructions should be detailed enough that your teammate can complete the setup without your help.

### Step 3: Submit  

Finally, log in to Moodle. Locate the newly created quiz and submit the link to your teammate's repo.  

---

That's it! Write clear instructions, test thoroughly, and collaborate effectively.
